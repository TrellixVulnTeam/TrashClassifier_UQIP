# TrashClassifier
Recycling is growing financially infeasible because trash is being <br/>
incorrectly recycled. Thus, I sought out to create a trash classifier <br/>
that could classify trash as glass, metal, cardboard, plastic, paper <br/>
or trash. This would allow users to correctly dispose of their <br/>
trash and reducing contamination. <br/>
